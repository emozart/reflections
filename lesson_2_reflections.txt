A new folder is created with name ".git". This folder has the information about the git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediary place where we can put only the files we want to commit. We can have many files modified and as the commit is made with relationated modifications we ca choose what put together in eath commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
We can use the commands "git diff", to compare the work directory with staging area, "git diff --staging" to compare the staging area with last commit, and check the changes before make a commit.

it use a graphical way to show the branch structure. It's a easy mode to analisis the structure.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The result file is the union of the two branches in reference to the original file.
We do the graph to reprensent the merges we did.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Pros:
We save a lot of time as we don't need to check all the modifications in code.
Cons:
Sometimes we will have conflicts and we have to solve it manually. But it shows where is the conflict and
it's easy to solve it.
