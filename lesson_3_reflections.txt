When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when we need to work with others or when we need to use more than one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Bacause I can work on modifications that I don't want to share because its not ready...
